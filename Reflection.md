## **Columbia Reflection**

  During this two week long Columbia summer session on Data Analysis and Machine Learning I have learned many things. Some things I have learned include data cleaning, modeling, interpreting, ethical uses, ethical fairness, data visualizations with python and different libraries, and also the full research method on how to analyze and interpret any dataset with a hypothesis and python tools. During my final project I was the main Data Scientist / Modeler, which means I was in charge of most of the initial data cleaning, sorting, filtering, and graphing. I am also in charge of turning those data information into something useful such as functions, definitions, numerical values, etc. One thing that I would do differently is take a more slower approach in order to make more analyses and interpretations.
